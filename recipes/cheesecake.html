    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        <p> Smooth, creamy, and utterly irresistible — cheesecake is the kind of dessert that feels like a little slice of luxury. </p>
        <p> Every bite melts on your tongue, with rich cream cheese filling nestled on top of a buttery graham cracker crust. </p>
        <p> Whether it's classic New York-style, swirled with fruit, or drizzled in chocolate, cheesecake knows how to steal the spotlight.</p> 
        <p> It's the perfect balance of sweet and tangy, with just the right amount of decadence to keep you coming back for more. One slice is never enough — but who says it has to be?</p>
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
<p>
    <ul>
       <li> 18 graham crackers, crushed</li>

       <li>3 tablespoons melted butter</li>

       <li>1 cup sour cream</li>

       <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>

       <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>

       <li>4 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese</li>

       <li>1 ½ cups white sugar</li>

       <li>⅔ cup milk</li>

       <li>4 large eggs</li>

       <li>1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest</li>

       <li>1 teaspoon finely grated orange zest</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<p>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease the bottom and sides of a 9-inch springform pan.</li>

        <li>Mix graham cracker crumbs and melted butter together in a bowl until evenly moistened. Press crumb mixture into the bottom and about 1/2 inch up the sides of the springform pan.</li>

        <li>Whisk sour cream, flour, and vanilla extract together in a bowl; set aside.</li>

        <li>Stir cream cheese and sugar together with a wooden spoon in a separate bowl until evenly incorporated, 3 to 5 minutes; add milk and whisk until just combined. Whisk in eggs, one at a time, stirring well after each addition. Stir in lemon zest, orange zest, and sour cream mixture; whisk until just incorporated. Pour mixture into prepared springform pan.</li>

        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the edges have nicely puffed and the surface of the cheesecake is firm except for a small spot in the center that will jiggle when the pan is gently shaken, about 1 hour.</li>

        <li>When the cheesecake is done, turn off the oven and let it cool in the oven for 3 to 4 hours. This prevents any cracks from forming on the top of the cheesecake.</li>
    </ol>
