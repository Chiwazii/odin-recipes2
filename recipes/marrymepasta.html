    <h1>Marry Me Pasta</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Marry Me Shrimp Pasta is the kind of dish that wins hearts with just one bite. </p>
    <p>Juicy, tender shrimp simmered in a rich, creamy sun-dried tomato sauce with garlic, Parmesan, and a touch of spice — it's pure magic wrapped around every twirl of pasta. </p>
    <p> The sauce clings to each noodle, silky and flavorful, with just enough heat to keep things interesting. </p>
    <p> It's the perfect balance of indulgent and comforting — the kind of meal that leaves everyone at the table falling head over heels and coming back for seconds... or maybe even proposing.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>12 ounces  uncooked calamarata or rigatoni pasta</li>

            <li>1 pound jumbo peeled and deveined tail-on raw shrimp</li>

            <li>1/3 cup coarsely chopped sun-dried tomatoes in oil, plus 2 tablespoons oil from jar, divided</li>

            <li>1 1/2 tablespoons sun-dried tomato spread</li>

            <li>5 large garlic cloves, grated</li>

            <li>1 1/2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>

            <li>3/4 cup dry white wine</li>

            <li>1 1/2 cups chicken broth</li>

            <li>3/4 cup heavy cream</li>

            <li>3/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese </li>

            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons dried Italian seasoning</li>

            <li>3/4 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>

            <li>chopped fresh basil</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Cook pasta in salted water according to package directions; drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons sun-dried tomato oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add shrimp and cook until pink on both sides and just cooked through, turning once, about 2 minutes per side; transfer to a separate bowl and set aside.</li>
        <li>Add sun-dried tomatoes, tomato spread, and garlic to the same skillet; cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in flour and continue cooking, stirring constantly, 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Whisk in wine, scraping up any browned bits from bottom of pan. Bring to a simmer and cook, undisturbed, until slightly reduced, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add broth, heavy cream, parmesan cheese, Italian seasoning, and smoked paprika; whisk until fully combined. Reduce heat to medium and continue cooking, whisking occasionally, until slightly thickened and just coats the back of a spoon, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to low; add cooked pasta and shrimp to skillet. Cook, stirring often, until evenly coated and heated through, about 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat; garnish with basil and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
